# Automatic Orchestration Rules

**Purpose**: Agents automatically detect task type and follow the correct systematic process.

**Design basis**: Implements Principles F3 (Token & Context Optimization), D2 (Deterministic Enforcement), and D3 (Durable Artifacts). Architecture: `docs/INSTRUCTION_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**🚨 CRITICAL**: These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Follow them without user prompting.

---

## 🤖 Proactive Session Start (AUTOMATIC!)

**At first message, tokens reset, or user returns - DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY:**

### 1. Silently Read Context
```bash
# Every command needs || true to prevent exit code errors
cat STATUS.md 2>/dev/null || true
cat HUMAN_NEEDED.md 2>/dev/null | head -20 || true
cat .agentic-state/AGENTS_ACTIVE.md 2>/dev/null || true
ls .agentic-state/WIP.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 2. Greet User with Recap

```
👋 Welcome back! Here's where we are:

**Last session**: [From JOURNAL.md/STATUS.md]
**Current focus**: [From STATUS.md]

**Next steps** (pick one or tell me something else):
1. [Next planned task]
2. [Another option]
3. [Address blockers - if any]

What would you like to work on?
```

### 3. Handle Special Cases

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| .agentic-state/WIP.md exists | "⚠️ Previous work interrupted! Continue, review, or rollback?" |
| HUMAN_NEEDED has items | "📋 [N] items need your input" |
| Upgrade pending | "🔄 Framework upgraded to vX.Y.Z, applying updates..." |

**Why proactive**: User shouldn't ask "where were we?" - you tell them automatically.

## Auto-Detection Triggers

### Core Workflow Triggers

| User Request Pattern | Auto-Trigger | What To Do |
|---------------------|--------------|------------|
| (first message) | **Proactive Start** | Greet with context + options |
| "implement F-####" / "build feature" / "create [feature]" | **Feature Pipeline** | Follow Feature Implementation flow |
| "fix I-####" / "fix bug" / "fix issue" | **Issue Pipeline** | Follow Issue Resolution flow |
| "commit" / "ready to commit" | **Before Commit** | Run `before_commit.md` checklist |
| "done with feature" / "feature complete" | **Feature Complete** | Run `feature_complete.md` checklist |
| "end session" / "stopping work" | **Session End** | Run `session_end.md` checklist |
| "review code" / "check this" | **Review** | Run `review_checklist.md` |

### Domain & Design Triggers

| User Request Pattern | Auto-Trigger | Agent | What To Do |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| "game rules" / "business logic" / "domain model" / "state machine" | **Domain Logic** | domain-agent | Define rules BEFORE coding |
| "design" / "mockup" / "wireframe" / "UI for" / "layout" | **Design** | design-agent | Create visual designs |

|---------------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| "check compliance" / "did I follow" / "verify process" | **Compliance** | compliance-agent | Verify framework adherence |

### Using Context Manifests

When triggering a specialized agent, use `context-for-role.sh` for minimal context:

```bash
# Get focused context for the agent
bash .agentic/tools/context-for-role.sh domain-agent F-0042 --dry-run
# Shows: Token budget: 4000, Files to load, Tokens used

# Pass assembled context to subagent (saves 60-80% tokens)
```

See `.agentic/agents/context-manifests/` for all role definitions

## Feature Pipeline (AUTO-INVOKED)

**Trigger**: User mentions implementing a feature (F-#### or general)

**CRITICAL PRE-CONDITION (feature_tracking=yes)**: If the user describes a feature without a feature ID:
1. Assign the next available F-XXXX ID in spec/FEATURES.md
2. Create spec/acceptance/F-XXXX.md with acceptance criteria
3. THEN proceed with the pipeline below

Do NOT proceed to step 4 (IMPLEMENT) without completing step 1 (VERIFY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA EXIST).

### Automatic Steps (DO ALL OF THESE)

```
1. VERIFY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA EXIST
   ├─ feature_tracking=yes: Check spec/acceptance/F-####.md exists
   ├─ feature_tracking=no: Check OVERVIEW.md has criteria
   └─ If missing: CREATE THEM FIRST (rough is OK)

2. CHECK PLAN-REVIEW SETTING
   └─ Read STACK.md → plan_review_enabled (default: yes for formal profile)
   ├─ If yes: Run `ag plan F-####` first — tell user review loop is active
   │          and mention max iterations from plan_review_max_iterations
   └─ If no: Proceed directly (or run ag plan --no-review for simple plan)

3. CHECK DEVELOPMENT MODE
   └─ Read STACK.md → development_mode (default: standard)

4. IMPLEMENT
   ├─ Write code meeting acceptance criteria
   ├─ Add @feature annotations
   └─ Keep small, focused changes

5. TEST
   ├─ Write tests as specified in spec/acceptance/F-####.md → ## Tests
   ├─ All tests must pass
   └─ Smoke test: RUN THE APPLICATION

6. UPDATE SPECS (MANDATORY - NOT OPTIONAL)
   ├─ feature_tracking=yes: Update spec/FEATURES.md status
   ├─ feature_tracking=no: Update OVERVIEW.md
   └─ This is part of "done", not afterthought

7. UPDATE DOCS
   ├─ JOURNAL.md (what was accomplished)
   ├─ CONTEXT_PACK.md (if architecture changed)
   └─ STATUS.md (next steps)

8. DOC LIFECYCLE (if STACK.md ## Docs has entries)
   ├─ `ag docs F-####` or `docs.sh --trigger feature_done`
   ├─ Drafts registered docs (lessons, architecture, changelog, etc.)
   ├─ Formal profile: also drafts pr-trigger docs (changelog, readme)
   └─ Human reviews drafts in git diff, removes `<!-- draft: -->` markers

9. BEFORE COMMIT
   └─ Run before_commit.md checklist
```

### Non-Negotiable Gates

| Gate | Check | Block If |
|------|-------|----------|
| Acceptance Criteria | `spec/acceptance/F-####.md` (feature_tracking=yes) or criteria in any form (feature_tracking=no) | acceptance_criteria=blocking: Missing = cannot proceed |
| Tests Pass | Run test suite | Any failure = cannot ship |
| Smoke Test | Actually run the app | Strongly recommended — verify manually before shipping |
| Specs Updated | FEATURES.md and STATUS.md current | Stale = cannot commit (enforced by pre-commit-check.sh when feature_tracking=yes) |
| No Untracked Files | `check-untracked.sh` clean | Untracked = warn before commit |

†Smoke testing and anti-hallucination are behavioral principles reinforced by memory seed and LLM tests. They cannot be verified by scripts.

## Brownfield Spec Pipeline (triggered by `ag specs`)

**Trigger**: User runs `ag specs` or asks to generate specs for an existing codebase

### Automatic Steps

```
1. CHECK: Discovery report exists → if not, run discover.py
2. CHECK: Domains detected → if only 1 small domain, use quick inline path
   - Small: 1 domain AND ≤8 clusters → quick inline spec generation
   - Large: >1 domain OR >8 clusters → systematic domain-by-domain approach
3. CREATE PLAN: Brownfield spec plan via plan-review loop
   - Domain map with boundaries, priorities, approach per domain
   - Reviewer checks: boundaries correct? anything missed? priorities sensible?
   - Plan artifact: .agentic-journal/plans/brownfield-specs-plan.md
   - Uses checkbox format: - [ ] Domain (type, ~N features)
4. PER DOMAIN (in priority order):
   a. Read key source files (1-2 per cluster, max ~10 per domain)
   b. Generate features with `- Domain:` metadata tag
   c. Generate Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
   d. Write FEATURES.md entries + spec/acceptance/F-####.md files
   e. Ask user: "Does this look right for [Domain]? Merge/split/adjust?"
   f. Mark domain as COMPLETED in plan artifact (change - [ ] to - [x])
5. CROSS-DOMAIN REVIEW:
   - Check for duplicate features across domains
   - Check for gaps (code areas not covered)
   - Final user confirmation
6. TOKEN COST CHECK:
   - If feature count > 50: suggest `organize_features.py --by domain`
7. UPDATE: FEATURES.md, STATUS.md, JOURNAL.md
```

### Multi-Session Support

Brownfield spec generation can span multiple sessions:
- Progress tracked via checkboxes in plan artifact
- Session start detects active plan → suggests resuming with `ag specs`
- `ag specs --status` shows domain completion progress

---

## Issue Pipeline (AUTO-INVOKED)

**Trigger**: User mentions fixing an issue (I-#### or general bug)

### Automatic Steps

```
1. UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE
   ├─ Read spec/ISSUES.md for I-#### details
   ├─ Or understand user's bug description
   └─ Identify reproduction steps
   
2. WRITE FAILING TEST
   └─ Test that proves the bug exists
   
3. FIX THE BUG
   └─ Minimal code change to fix
   
4. VERIFY TEST PASSES
   └─ The bug test now passes
   
5. SMOKE TEST
   └─ Actually run the app, verify fix works
   
6. UPDATE ISSUES.MD
   └─ Status: closed, Resolution: fixed
   
7. BEFORE COMMIT
   └─ Run before_commit.md checklist
```

---

## Session Start (AUTO-INVOKED)

**Trigger**: First message of a session, or user says "start session"

### Automatic Steps

```
1. CHECK FOR UPGRADE
   └─ cat .agentic/.upgrade_pending (follow if exists)
   
2. CHECK FOR WIP
   └─ ls .agentic-state/WIP.md (resume if exists)
   
3. READ CONTEXT
   ├─ STATUS.md (what's current focus)
   ├─ HUMAN_NEEDED.md (any blockers resolved?)
   └─ JOURNAL.md (last session summary)
   
4. CONFIRM WITH USER
   └─ "Continuing from [X]. Should I proceed or change focus?"
```

---

## Feature Complete (AUTO-INVOKED)

**Trigger**: User says "feature done" or agent believes feature is complete

### Automatic Checks (ALL MUST PASS)

```
□ All acceptance criteria met
□ Smoke test passed (actually ran the app)
□ All tests pass
□ FEATURES.md/OVERVIEW.md updated with status: shipped
□ Code annotations added (@feature, @acceptance)
□ JOURNAL.md updated
□ No untracked files
□ Ready for human validation
```

**If any fail**: Do NOT mark as shipped. Complete the missing item first.

---

## Before Commit (AUTO-INVOKED)

**Trigger**: User says "commit" or agent is about to commit

### Automatic Checks (ALL MUST PASS)

```
□ No .agentic-state/WIP.md exists (work is complete)
□ All tests pass
□ Smoke test passed (for user-facing changes)
□ Quality checks pass (if enabled)
□ FEATURES.md/OVERVIEW.md updated
□ JOURNAL.md updated
□ No untracked files in project directories
□ Human approval obtained
```

**If any fail**: Do NOT commit. Fix first.

---

## Agent Delegation (When Using Sub-Agents)

If you're the **Orchestrator Agent** or coordinating multiple agents:

### Verify Each Agent's Work

| Agent | Verify Before Moving On |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Planning | `spec/acceptance/F-####.md` exists with testable criteria |
| Test | Tests exist and currently FAIL |
| Implementation | Tests now PASS |
| Review | No critical issues raised |
| Spec Update | FEATURES.md shows `Status: shipped` |
| Documentation | Relevant docs updated |
| Git | Commit message clear, all files tracked |

### Block If Quality Gates Fail

```bash
# Run compliance checks
bash .agentic/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh

# If exit code != 0, STOP and fix
```

---

## Framework Promises (MUST BE KEPT)

The framework promises these things. Agents MUST enforce them:

| Promise | Enforcement |
|---------|-------------|
| "Specs drive development" | Cannot implement without acceptance criteria |
| "Tests verify correctness" | Cannot ship without passing tests |
| "Documentation stays current" | Cannot commit without updating docs |
| "Small batch development" | One feature at a time, small commits |
| "Quality gates block bad code" | pre-commit-check.sh must pass |
| "Nothing gets forgotten" | Checklists are mandatory, not optional |

---

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)

❌ **Implementing without acceptance criteria first**
❌ **Marking shipped without running the application**
❌ **Committing without updating FEATURES.md/OVERVIEW.md**
❌ **Skipping smoke tests ("tests pass" is not enough)**
❌ **Treating checklists as optional**
❌ **Waiting for user to remind you about specs**

---

## How To Use This Document

**You don't need to read this every time.** Instead:

1. **Recognize the trigger** from user's message
2. **Follow the appropriate pipeline** automatically
3. **Verify gates at each step** before proceeding
4. **Show progress** to user (completed checklist items)

**The user should never need to remind you to:**
- Update specs
- Run smoke tests
- Check for untracked files
- Follow the definition of done

These are YOUR responsibility as an agent following this framework.

## Reference: Gates, Delegation, and Session Protocols

*(Moved from instruction files — these are structurally enforced, not constitutional rules)*

### Enforced Gates (Settings-Driven)

| Gate | Setting | Formal default | Discovery default |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Acceptance criteria | `acceptance_criteria` | **blocking** | recommended |
| WIP before commit | `wip_before_commit` | **blocking** | warning |
| Test execution | (always enforced) | tests must pass | tests for changed files |
| Complexity limits | `max_files_per_commit` etc. | 10/500/500 | 15/1000/1000 |
| Pre-commit checks | `pre_commit_checks` | **full** | fast |
| Feature status | `feature_tracking` | **yes** (shipped needs acceptance) | no |
| Docs reviewed | `docs_gate` | **blocking** | off |

Override any setting: `ag set <key> <value>` | View resolved settings: `ag set --show`

Escape hatches (feature branches only): SKIP_TESTS=1 or SKIP_COMPLEXITY=1

### Agent Boundaries

| ALWAYS | ASK FIRST | NEVER |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Run tests before "done" | Add dependencies | Commit without approval |
| Update specs with code | Change architecture | Push to main directly |
| Follow existing patterns | Delete files | Modify secrets/.env |

### Agent Mode (model selection for delegation)

Check `agent_mode` in STACK.md: `premium` | `balanced` (default) | `economy`
- premium: opus for planning/impl/review, sonnet for search
- balanced (default): opus for planning, sonnet for impl/review, haiku for search
- economy: sonnet for planning, haiku for everything else
- Custom: check `models:` section. Docs: `.agentic/workflows/agent_mode.md`

### Task Tool Delegation (Claude Code)

| Task Type | subagent_type | premium | balanced | economy |
|-----------|---------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Codebase search | `Explore` | sonnet | haiku | haiku |
| Planning/architecture | `Plan` | opus | opus | sonnet |
| Implementation | `general-purpose` | opus | sonnet | haiku |
| Testing/review | `general-purpose` | opus | sonnet | haiku |

### Session Protocols

- **START**: Run `ag start`. Read STATUS.md, HUMAN_NEEDED.md, check .agentic-state/WIP.md. If WIP.md exists: warn about interrupted work and suggest resuming.
- **END**: Run `.agentic/checklists/session_end.md`, update JOURNAL.md.
- **DONE**: Run `.agentic/checklists/feature_complete.md` before claiming done.
